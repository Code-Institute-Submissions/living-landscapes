    * A dedicated 'About us' page has been created, which includes content on the company's mission,the services they provide and a detailed description on each team member and their skills.

    * An online enquiry form has been created within the 'Contact Us' section. Quick links to this page have been provided in the footer and in the header (hero image banner) of each page.

* As a prospective client who would prefer to speak over the phone rather than email, I would like to be able to request a call-back to an online enquiry and clearly be able to view a telephone number and call-times.
    * A preferred method of contact can be specified on the online enquiry form. The company's contact telephone number is also visable on the footer of each page. 

* As a prospective client, I would like to view a portfolio of past work, so that I can know what to expect.  
    * A 'Portfolio' page has been created which is separated into 'Award-Winning Gardens' and 'Our Recent Creations'. A variety of residential and commerical designs have been included to give a well-rounded representation of the company.

    * The content and imagery used in the 'Portfolio' section describes the planting designs in detail.

    * The overall services provided by the company are listed in the 'About Us' web page. 
    * The company's past creations are viewable in the 'Portfolio' web page. This gives an in-depth overview of the standard which can be expected of the company.
